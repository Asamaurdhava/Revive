# Project Revive

> *Study what you really have to! Get your personalized syllabus now!*

**Hackathon Project** - Presented at SunHacks 2023, Arizona State University (ASU)

A learning assistant system designed to help neophyte and beginner programmers efficiently restart or continue their programming education journey through personalized curriculum recommendations.

## Project Overview

Project Revive addresses a common challenge in programming education: knowing where to pick up after a learning break or understanding what topics to study next. The system analyzes a user's current knowledge level and previously learned topics, then generates a customized learning path to optimize their study progression.

### Core Features

- **Learning Progress Assessment** - Evaluates user's current knowledge across beginner, intermediate, and advanced levels
- **Personalized Study Plans** - Generates tailored syllabi based on individual learning gaps
- **Topic Progression Tracking** - Maps learning journey across comprehensive programming curricula
- **Interactive Learning Interface** - Clean, responsive design with glassmorphism UI elements

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Architecture
- **HTML5** - Semantic structure and accessibility
- **CSS3** - Advanced styling with glassmorphism effects and responsive design
- **JavaScript** - Dynamic content generation and user interaction handling
- **Google Fonts Integration** - Poppins font family for modern typography

### Learning Algorithm
The system categorizes programming concepts into three progressive levels:

**Beginner Level:** Syntax, Variables, Data Types, Operators, Control Flow, Strings, Exception Handling, File Operations, OOP Fundamentals, Inheritance, Polymorphism

**Intermediate Level:** Collections, Generics, Reflection, Annotations, JUnit Testing, Mockito, Hamcrest, Spring Boot, Hibernate, JPA, Servlets, JSP

**Advanced Level:** Design Patterns, JVM Architecture, Memory Management, Garbage Collection, Concurrency, Networking, Security, Cloud Computing, Big Data, Machine Learning

### Key Functionality
```javascript
// Core learning assessment functions
LBeginner(learned, beginners)    // Beginner level progression analysis
LIntermediate(learned, intermediates)  // Intermediate level gap identification  
LAdvanced(learned, advances)     // Advanced level curriculum planning
```

## User Experience

### Learning Assessment Process
1. **Level Selection** - Choose current proficiency level (Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced)
2. **Topic Identification** - Select the last completed topic from comprehensive curriculum
3. **Gap Analysis** - System identifies learning gaps and suggests next steps
4. **Syllabus Generation** - Receive personalized study recommendations

### Interface Design
- **Glassmorphism UI** - Modern, translucent design elements
- **Responsive Navigation** - Hamburger menu with smooth animations
- **Dynamic Backgrounds** - Scroll-triggered visual transitions
- **Accessibility Focus** - Semantic HTML and intuitive user interactions
