# Revive
Project Revive, presented at Sunhacks 2023 at Arizona State University (ASU), features a system fabricated to assist neophyte or beginner coders in starting or restarting their programming learning journey. The project analyzes a user's previously learned topics and suggests further areas of study to help them progress in their coding education.
